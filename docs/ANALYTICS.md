## Event Tracking

### Automatic Events (Built-in by PostHog)
- `$pageview` - Page views
- `$pageleave` - Page exits
- Session starts/ends
- Device and browser info
- Geographic location (if enabled)

### Custom Events

**Map Interactions:**
- `map_marker_clicked` - User clicked a location marker
  - Properties: location_id, location_type, has_candy, is_start, address, user_lat, user_lng
- `map_directions_requested` - User requested walking directions
  - Properties: from_lat, from_lng, to_lat, to_lng
- `map_center_on_user` - User clicked "Center on me" button
  - Properties: user_lat, user_lng
- `map_cluster_clicked` - User clicked a marker cluster
  - Properties: cluster_size, user_lat, user_lng
- `map_user_location_enabled` - GPS permission status (filtered from analytics)
  - Properties: granted (boolean), accuracy (if granted), error_code (if denied)
  - **Note:** This event is excluded from Event Breakdown, Recent Activity, and Engagement metrics to prevent skewing numbers

**Location List Interactions:**
- `location_sorted` - User changed sort order
  - Properties: sort_by (distance/address/none)
- `location_filter_applied` - User applied a filter

## Multi-Neighborhood Architecture

### Single PostHog Project Approach

**How It Works:**
1. Both neighborhoods (Uitzicht & Sandown) use the **same PostHog project**
2. Every event automatically includes a `neighborhood` property (set from `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEIGHBORHOOD_NAME`)
3. All HogQL queries filter by this property
4. Each admin dashboard shows only their neighborhood's data

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ **No credit card needed** - Free tier supports 1 project
- ‚úÖ **Automatic filtering** - Queries include `WHERE properties.neighborhood = 'X'`
- ‚úÖ **Data isolation** - Admins see only their deployment's metrics
- ‚úÖ **Easy setup** - Single set of credentials for both deployments
- ‚úÖ **Cost effective** - 1M events/month shared (plenty for 2 neighborhoods)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Automatically registered on every event:
{
  neighborhood: "Uitzicht",  // or "Sandown"
  event_year: "2025",
  deployment_url: "https://uitzicht.trueburn.co.za"
}
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create PostHog Account (Free Tier)

1. Sign up at https://posthog.com (free - no credit card required)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your credentials:
   - **Project API Key** ‚Üí `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`
   - **Project ID** (from Settings) ‚Üí `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID`
   - **Personal API Key** (create with "Query Read" permission) ‚Üí `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY`

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Add to **both** Vercel deployments (Uitzicht AND Sandown):

```env
# PostHog Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.posthog.com
POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=phx_xxxxx
POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID=12345
```

**Important:** Use the **SAME** credentials for both deployments.

### 3. Deploy & Verify

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Visit `/admin` on both deployments
3. Navigate around the public site to generate events
4. Check PostHog dashboard to see events coming in
5. Verify `neighborhood` property is set correctly on all events

### 4. Optional: Create Custom Dashboard in PostHog

You can create additional dashboards in PostHog with filters:
- Dashboard 1: Filter by `neighborhood = "Uitzicht"`
- Dashboard 2: Filter by `neighborhood = "Sandown"`
- Dashboard 3: Combined view (no filter)

- NO personally identifiable information (PII)
- NO user names, emails, or phone numbers

### Privacy Controls

**What We DON'T Track:**
- User names or emails
- Exact GPS coordinates of users
- Payment information
- Personal messages

**GDPR Compliance:**
- PostHog free tier includes EU hosting option
- Data retention: 7 days (free tier) or configurable
- Users can opt-out via browser "Do Not Track" settings
- No tracking of authenticated user emails (only anonymous IDs)

**Recommended:**
- Add privacy policy link to footer
- Mention analytics in terms of service
- Provide opt-out mechanism if required by your jurisdiction

---

## Performance Impact

**Minimal Impact:**
- ‚úÖ PostHog loads asynchronously (no blocking)
- ‚úÖ Events batched and sent in background
- ‚úÖ API responses cached (30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard auto-refresh intervals optimized (30-60s)

**Bundle Size:**
- `posthog-js`: ~40KB gzipped
- `posthog-node`: Server-only (no client impact)

**Network:**
- Event tracking: ~1-2 KB per event
- Analytics API: ~2-5 KB per response (cached)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Using the Built-in Diagnostics Tool

The easiest way to troubleshoot PostHog configuration issues is to use the built-in diagnostics panel:

1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
2. Expand the "Live Analytics" section
3. Click "Run Diagnostics" in the "PostHog Configuration Diagnostics" panel
4. Review the results:
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = Configured correctly
   - ‚ùå Red alerts = Missing or incorrect configuration
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings = Potential issues (wrong key format, etc.)
5. Follow the recommendations provided

The diagnostics tool will:
- Check all environment variables are set
- Verify API key formats (phc_ for Project Key, phx_ for Personal Key)
- Test the PostHog API connection
- Provide specific recommendations for fixing issues

### Events Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Environment variables set correctly in Vercel
2. PostHog project key is correct (starts with `phc_`)
3. `neighborhood` property is set (check PostHog Live Events view)
4. Browser console for PostHog errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Local testing
console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY) // Should output your key
```

### Dashboard Shows No Data

**Check:**
1. PostHog Personal API Key has "Query Read" permission
2. Personal API Key starts with `phx_` (not `phc_`)
3. Project ID is correct (numeric ID, not project slug)
4. Admin is authenticated
5. Browser console for API errors

**Solution:**
Use the diagnostics tool at `/admin` or test the API endpoint directly:
```bash
# Test API endpoints directly
curl https://your-domain.com/api/analytics/live \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie"
```

### Wrong Neighborhood Data

**Check:**
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEIGHBORHOOD_NAME` is set correctly in Vercel
2. Both deployments have different values for this variable

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify in PostHog Live Events
# Filter by: properties.neighborhood = "Your Name"
```

### Rate Limiting

PostHog free tier limits:
- 240 requests/minute
- 1200 requests/hour

**Solution:**
- Increase auto-refresh intervals
- Reduce number of dashboard components
- Upgrade to paid tier if needed

---

## Free Tier Limits

**PostHog Free Tier (No Credit Card):**
- ‚úÖ 1 million events/month
- ‚úÖ 1 project (supports both neighborhoods)
- ‚úÖ Session recording (5,000 recordings/month)
- ‚úÖ Unlimited team members
- ‚úÖ 7-day data retention
- ‚úÖ Community support

**Estimated Usage:**
- 2 neighborhoods √ó 100 visitors/day √ó 10 events/visitor = **2,000 events/day**
- Monthly: **~60,000 events** (well within free tier)

---

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### Session Recording

PostHog can record actual user sessions (video playback):

**Enable in `src/lib/posthog/client.ts`:**
```typescript
posthog.init(key, {
  // ... existing config
  session_recording: {
    recordCanvas: false, // Don't record canvas (map tiles)
    recordCrossOriginIframes: false,
  },
});
```

**Privacy:** Sensitive data is automatically masked.

### A/B Testing & Feature Flags

PostHog supports feature flags for A/B testing:

```typescript
const posthog = usePostHog();

if (posthog?.isFeatureEnabled('new-map-style')) {
  // Show new map tiles
}
```

### Funnels

Track user journeys in PostHog dashboard:
1. Landing ‚Üí Map view
2. Map view ‚Üí Location clicked
3. Location clicked ‚Üí Directions requested
