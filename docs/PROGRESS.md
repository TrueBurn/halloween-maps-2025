# Halloween Maps 2025 - Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed (2025-10-21)

### Setup & Infrastructure
- T3 App initialized (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, tRPC)
- **Two Supabase databases created** (multi-neighborhood architecture):
  - **Neighborhood 1**: Primary project (dev + production)
  - **Neighborhood 2**: Secondary project (production)
- Migration files created in `supabase/migrations/`
- **MCP servers configured** for database management:
  - `supabase-neighborhood1` - Manages first database
  - `supabase-neighborhood2` - Manages second database
- Environment variables configured for both neighborhoods
- Template cleaned (removed T3 examples)
- System font stack (removed Geist to eliminate warnings)

### Database
- Enums: `location_type`, `route` (age groups for starting points only)
- Table: `locations` (15 columns, RLS enabled)
- TypeScript types generated
- **Migration files** in `supabase/migrations/`:
  - `create_enums.sql`
  - `create_locations_table.sql`
  - `setup_rls_policies.sql`
  - `allow_anonymous_example_inserts.sql`
  - `allow_anonymous_example_deletes.sql`
  - `add_store_location_type.sql`
  - `route_enum_to_text.sql`
  - `fix_rls_select_policy_for_admin_updates.sql` - **Separate SELECT policies for public/authenticated users**
  - `add_animal_charity_location_type.sql` - **Add AnimalCharity for donation stations**
- **All 9 migrations applied to both databases**
- **Route field usage**: Only assigned to starting points (`is_start = true`) to indicate age group (Over 8, Under 8, Toddlers)
- **RLS Policies**: Separate SELECT policies - public users see only participating locations, authenticated users see all

### Components Built
- `Navigation.tsx` - Nav bar with Lucide icons + auto-opening info modal with cluster legend (React Portal, localStorage tracking)
- `MapView.tsx` - Full Leaflet map with smart updates, dynamic popups, routing, marker clustering, bounds calculation
- `LocationMarker.tsx` - Custom Lucide icons with status badges
- `UserLocationButton.tsx` - FAB to center on user location
- `LocationList.tsx` - Filterable/sortable list view
- `LocationCard.tsx` - Card component with distance on line 2
- `useLocations` - Supabase data hook with real-time updates + localStorage cache
- `useUserLocation` - GPS tracking hook with watchPosition + localStorage cache + 60s caching

### Pages
- `/` - Map view (fully functional with dynamic import, localStorage cache)
- `/locations` - List view (filtering, sorting, distance calculation)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard with CRUD operations
- `/admin/login` - Admin authentication with forgot password link
- `/admin/reset-password` - Password reset for invites and password recovery
- `/auth/confirm` - Email token verification handler (server route)
- `/error` - User-friendly error page with specific error messages
- `/dev` - Development tools UI (seed/clear/stats, dev only)

### Performance Optimizations ⚡ ✅
- ✅ **localStorage Caching** - Instant page loads
  - User location cached (key: `halloween-maps-user-location`)
  - Locations data cached (key: `halloween-maps-locations`)
  - Data loads instantly from cache while fresh data fetches in background
  - Persists across browser sessions
- ✅ **Smart Map Updates** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
  - Map only re-centers when locations change (not on GPS updates)
  - Popups stay open when switching tabs
  - User location updates don't recreate markers
  - Dynamic popup content generated on open with latest distance calculation
- ✅ **Intelligent Bounds Calculation** - Better initial map view
  - User location included in bounds only if within 5km of locations
  - Prevents excessive zoom-out for distant users
- ✅ **GPS Optimization** - Better permission handling
  - 60-second cached position to prevent permission re-prompts
- ✅ **Marker Clustering** - Prevents visual clutter with overlapping locations
  - Leaflet.markercluster plugin integration
  - Halloween-themed cluster icons (🦇 bat, 🕷️ spider, 👻 ghost)
  - Color-coded gradients (orange for 2, green for 3, purple for 4+)
  - Tight clustering radius (15px) for minimal grouping
  - Auto-disables at zoom level 17 for individual marker selection
  - Spider-fy effect spreads markers at max zoom
  - Hover animations with glow effects
  - Info modal updated with cluster legend
- ✅ **UI Improvements**
  - Location card distance moved to line 2 (no address truncation)
  - Transparent routing collapse button (no grey box)
- ✅ **Mobile Browser Compatibility**
  - `viewport-fit=cover` meta tag enables safe area detection
  - Safe area insets for bottom-positioned elements (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`)
  - Dynamic viewport height (`100dvh`) with `100vh` fallback for map and list containers
  - Prevents content cutoff when mobile browser UI shows/hides
  - Works with Chrome bottom URL bar, iOS notches, and home indicators
  - Dynamically adapts as browser UI changes during scrolling

### Age Group UX Improvements 🎯 ✅
- ✅ **Map Enhancements**
  - Starting point markers 20% larger (48px vs 40px) with green borders
  - Easier to identify starting locations for different age groups
  - Popups show "⭐ Starting point for [age group]"
  - **Location counter** shows only candy-giving locations (excludes parking, refreshments)
- ✅ **Location List Improvements**
  - "Show Only Starting Points" toggle switch for quick filtering
  - Filter label changed to "Age Group (Starting Points)" for clarity
  - Location cards display "⭐ Starting point for Over 8/Under 8/Toddlers"
  - Age group no longer shown separately (integrated into starting point badge)
- ✅ **Admin Panel Improvements**
  - Route/age group field disabled unless "Starting Point" checkbox is selected
  - Helper text: "Check 'Starting Point' to assign an age group"
  - Table column renamed to "Age Group" for clarity
  - Non-starting locations show grayed-out italic dash in age group column
  - Visual distinction makes it clear which locations have age groups
- ✅ **Data Clarification**
  - Routes are age group identifiers for starting points ONLY
  - Regular participating locations do not have routes assigned
  - Seed data updated: 3 starting points (one per age group), 7 regular locations
